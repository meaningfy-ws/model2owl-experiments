[prettyModel-cleaned](https://github.com/meaningfy-ws/model2owl-experiments/tree/develop/project-files/prettyModel-cleaned) contains Enterprise Architect project file that is the basis of the exported XMI. The project has been cleaned to remove extra classes and the class resides in a new dedicated module needed to target the specific diagram in export.
